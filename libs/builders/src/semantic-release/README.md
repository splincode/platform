# @ng-easy/builders:semantic-release

This builder is a wrapper of [**semantic-release**](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) that automates the release workflow of Nx/Angular projects. It uses internally:

- [`@semantic-release/commit-analyzer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semantic-release/commit-analyzer)
- [`@semantic-release/release-notes-generator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semantic-release/release-notes-generator)
- [`@semantic-release/changelog`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semantic-release/changelog)
- [`@semantic-release/npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semantic-release/npm)
- [`@semantic-release/github`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semantic-release/github)
- [`@semantic-release/git`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semantic-release/git)

The configuration of the plugins is opinionated and it includes for configured projects:

- Generating the changelog
- NPM release
- GitHub release
- Update the package version in the source code

## Configuration of the builder

In your `angular.json`/`workspace.json` you can use the builder with:

```json
"release": {
  "builder": "@ng-easy/builders:semantic-release",
  "configurations": {
    "local": {
      "force": true
    }
  }
}
```

Additionally, you can use the following options:

- `dryRun`: defaults to `false`, runs the release process without releasing
- `force`: defaults to `false`, forces the release in a non CI environment, can be used to make a release locally
- `mode`: can be either `independent` or `sync`, defaults to `independent`, choose whether you want to make individual versioning or group all under the same version
- `branches`: branches configuration for workflow release as explained in [`semantic-release` docs](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/workflow-configuration.md#branches-properties), defaults to `["master", "main", "next", { "name": "beta", "prerelease": true }, { "name": "alpha", "prerelease": true }]`
- `releaseCommitMessage`: defaults to `chore(release): :package: \${project}@\${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n\${nextRelease.notes}`, the message for the release commit to upgrade the changelog and package version, refer to [`semantic-release/git` options](https://github.com/semantic-release/git#options)
- `changelog`: defaults to `true`, generates project's changelog
- `npm`: defaults to `true`, releases to `npm`
- `github`: defaults to `true`, releases to `github`

If using Nx, the `release` target has to be run respecting the order of dependencies. That can be configured in the `nx.json` root config file:

```json
{
  "tasksRunnerOptions": {
    "default": {
      "runner": "@nrwl/nx-cloud",
      "options": {
        "cacheableOperations": ["build"],
        "strictlyOrderedTargets": ["build", "release"]
      }
    }
  },
  "targetDependencies": {
    "build": [{ "target": "build", "projects": "dependencies" }],
    "release": [{ "target": "release", "projects": "dependencies" }]
  }
}
```

If using just the Angular CLI, make sure to perform releases according to the order of dependencies.

## How to use `independent` mode

With this mode each releasable library will have its own version according to [semver](https://semver.org/). This is the preferred approach.

[Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) follow the pattern `<type>[(optional scope)]: <description>`. When the builder is configured in `independent` mode, only the following commits will considered that apply for the individual project:

- Those without scope or scope equal to `*`
- Those where the scope is equal to the project name

Example of `angular.json`/`workspace.json`:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "library": {
      // Only commits like "feat: new feature", "feat(*): new feature" or "feat(library): new feature" will be considered
      "targets": {
        "build": {
          /* */
        },
        "release": {
          "builder": "@ng-easy/builders:semantic-release"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Dependencies will be calculated using Nx project graph. When `projectA` is a dependency of `projectB` and the first gets upgraded to a new version, it will create a new commit that will bump the version of the latter. It will happen only if both projects are a buildable and publishable library, having the `release` target correctly configured.

## How to use `sync` mode

With this mode each all libraries will have the same version.

Just use these options:

```json
"release": {
  "builder": "@ng-easy/builders:semantic-release",
  "options": {
    "mode": "sync"
  }
}
```

All commits will be considered for a potential version bump. Changelog will still be in each project, only containing the changes that apply to the specific library.

## Bump major version

```shell
git commit -m "feat: :sparkles: bump major version" -m "BREAKING CHANGE New version"
```

## Force a specific version

If you want to force a version bump not following semantic release run:

```shell
git tag {packageName}@{newVersion} # Force a new higher base version
git push --tags
git commit -m "fix({project}): :arrow_up: force version bump" --allow-empty # Force the semantic release process
git push
```

And then do a release.

## Authentication

The release process needs write permissions to the remote git repo. Please refer to [`semantic-release` authentication docs](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication) on how to setup env variables for your CI.

## Tips for GitHub Actions CI

Here you can find an example of a [workflow](https://github.com/ng-easy/platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml), below some details to consider:

```yml
name: Release
on:
  workflow_dispatch: # manual release
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # scheduled nightly release

jobs:
  npm:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          persist-credentials: false # Needed so that semantic release can use the admin token

      - name: Fetch latest base branch
        run: git fetch origin main

      # Setup node, install dependencies

      - name: Release
        run: npm run release # nx run-many --target=release --all / ng run project:release
        env:
          CI: true
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_TOKEN }} # Personal access token with repo permissions

      # Alternative using GitHub action
      - name: Release
        uses: mansagroup/nrwl-nx-action@v2
        with:
          targets: release
          nxCloud: 'true'
        env:
          CI: true
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RELEASE_TOKEN }} # Personal access token with repo permissions
```
